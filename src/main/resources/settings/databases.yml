# Optional database connections for storing bounties and player stats.
# You can connect to as many databases as you want. You could have 5 mySQL databases and 3 redis if you really wanted.

# The time in seconds between connection attempts of the database - set to 0 to disable
auto-connect-interval: 0
# you can change 'example-sql' to a different name if it helps you keep track of it

  type: SQL
  # all the regular database options
